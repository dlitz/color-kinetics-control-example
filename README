= Control a Philips Color Kinetics iColor Tile MX board using Python!

The iColor Tile MX is a 12-by-12 array of RGB LEDs, controlled by some software
that sends UDP packets to the board over a local Ethernet connection.

This is an example program showing how to control that board using Python.

The LEDs are arranged into two 6x12 banks of LEDs.  We send a separate packet
to update each bank.

More information about the iColor Tile MX can be found on the Philips website:
